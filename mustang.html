          <h3>Cobra</h3>
          <p>
            The Cobra Mustang is a revered and high-performance variant of the
            Ford Mustang, celebrated for its raw power and exceptional agility.
            With its origins dating back to collaborations between Ford and
            Carroll Shelby in the 1960s, the official Ford Mustang Cobra was
            introduced in 1993 as a production model. Boasting a formidable V8
            engine, specially tuned suspension, and various performance
            enhancements, the Cobra swiftly earned an iconic status among muscle
            car enthusiasts. Over time, it evolved into even more potent
            versions, featuring supercharged engines, lightweight components,
            and distinct Cobra badging. With its unmistakable growl and striking
            appearance, the Cobra Mustang has solidified its place as an emblem
            of American muscle cars and remains a beloved choice for
            thrill-seeking drivers and collectors alike

          <h3>McLaren</h3>
          <p>
            The M81 McLaren Mustang, a collaborative creation of McLaren and
            Ford in 1980, stands as a rare and remarkable performance car. With
            its 5.0-liter V8 engine tuned by McLaren, the M81 boasted impressive
            power and speed, setting it apart as one of the fastest Mustangs of
            its time. Its eye-catching decals and aerodynamic design added to
            its allure. Inside, the driver-focused cockpit offered both luxury
            and comfort. With limited production, the M81 McLaren Mustang
            remains a sought-after collector's item, symbolizing a unique moment
            when two automotive legends came together to craft an exceptional
            and enduring piece of automotive history.

          <h3>Ghia</h3>
          <p>
            The Ghia Ford Mustang was a special edition of the iconic Ford
            Mustang produced in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Named after the
            renowned Italian design house "Ghia," this variant showcased a more
            refined and luxurious approach to the classic muscle car. The Ghia
            package featured unique exterior styling elements, such as vinyl
            roofs, additional chrome accents, and distinctive badges, setting it
            apart from the standard Mustang models of its time. Inside, the Ghia
            Mustang boasted a more upscale and plush interior, often
            incorporating high-quality materials like premium leather,
            wood-grain trim, and enhanced comfort features. This special edition
            aimed to attract a different segment of buyers who valued both
            performance and sophistication. While the Ghia Ford Mustang didn't
            focus primarily on raw power and speed like some of its sportier
            counterparts, it offered a blend of style and comfort, appealing to
            those seeking a more elegant and refined driving experience. Today,
            the Ghia models have become collectibles, cherished for their unique
            design and contribution to the diverse history of the Ford Mustang
            lineup.
